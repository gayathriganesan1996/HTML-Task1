   <hr>
   <H2>Quick start </H2>
   <P>Get started by including Bootstrap’s production-ready CSS and JavaScript via CDN without the need for any build steps. See it in practice with this Bootstrap CodePen demo.</P>

<h2>JS components </h2>
<p>Curious which components explicitly require our JavaScript and Popper? Click the show components link below. If you’re at all unsure about the general page structure, keep reading for an example page template.</p>
<P>Bootstrap employs a handful of important global styles and settings, all of which are almost exclusively geared towards the normalization of cross browser styles.<br> Let’s dive in.</P>
<h2>Supported browsers</h2>
<pre>
    Bootstrap supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms.

    Alternative browsers which use the latest version of WebKit, Blink, or Gecko, whether directly or via the platform’s web view API, are not explicitly supported.
